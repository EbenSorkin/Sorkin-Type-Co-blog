			<h2>Merriweather Sans</h2>
			<p>Merriweather Sans is the san serif companion to Merriweather. Like Merriwetaher it comes in 4 weights designed to be especialy usable on screen. Althought it is a sans it has a classic stricture which makes ist voice noticeably different from other Google Fonts. Merriweather Sans took advantage of the fact that TTFA was available at the time it was designed to rapidly test with to ensure excellent windows rendering. Merriweather Sans was designed by Eben Sorkin.</p>

			<h2>Gelasio</h2>
			<p>Gelasio is a metrics compatible typeface designed to be exchangeable with Matthew Carter's Georgia. It is a Reale or tranitional design like Georgia but is less warm and more formal in feeling. Gelasio is not expected to be a Google font but may be used by Google elsewhere.Merriweather was designed by Eben Sorkin.</p>

						<article id="kav">
			<h2>Kavoon</h2>
			<p>Kavoon is a display face based on experiments with brush and ink. Kavoon's expressive features make words vivid and powerfully draw the reader in. Kavoon may be used from medium to large sizes.Kavoon was designed by Viktoriya Grabowska.</p>
			</article>
			
			<article id="pin">
			<h2>Pinyon</h2>
			<p>Pinyon Script is a romantic round hand script style font. It also sports swashes which are confident and showy somehow giving the type a feeling suggestive of the American west. Perhaps this is why, despite refinement and aristocratic style; Pinyon Script manages to feel so friendly. Nicole Script uses a high stroke contrast and is very slanted making it most suitable for use at larger sizes. Pinton Script was designed by Nicole Fally</p>
			</article>
			
			<article id="arm">
			<h2>Armata</h2>
			<p>Armata is a low contrast sans serif text face. In Aramata we find a mixture of a the familiar shapes and an aesthetic steadiness and strength with a small number of innovative and delicate gestures. Armata can be used in a wide range of sizes. This site is set in Armata. Armata was designed by Viktoriya Grabowska</p>
			</article>
			
			<article id="vol">
			<h2>Volataire</h2>
			<p>Voltaire is a low contrast condensed semi-geometric style sans serif. Voltaire is highly readable and will work from medium text sizes all the way up to larger display settings. Voltaire was inspired by 20th century Swedish posters whose letters have similar forms. Volatire was designed by Yvonne Sch√ºttler</p>
			</article>
			
			<article id="fru">
			<h2>Fructur</h2>
			<p>Fruktur appears to be a playful and powerful black letter type at first glance. However it's construction is closer to that of an upright italic. Fruktur offers some of the feeling of a black letter but with higher legibility and greater utility than a conventional black letter type. Fruktur is most useful from medium to large sizes. Fructur was designed by Viktoriya Grabowska</p>
			</article>
			
			<article id="don">
			<h2>Donegal</h2>
			<p>Donegal is a text typeface designed to be highly legible and comfortable when reading screens. Donegal's utility and personality consistently shows from small text sizes to display. Donegal uses the cut interior curve associated with W.A. Dwiggins. This feature is one of many that contribute to Donegal's distinctive and pleasing character. Donegal was designed by Gary Lonergan</p>
